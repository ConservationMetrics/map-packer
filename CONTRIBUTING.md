# Using Git

We use GitHub to host code, track issues, and accept pull requests.

## Git Branching

**We build and release from the `main` branch, so code merged here should always be stable.**

Prefer short-lived feature branches.

- Piecemeal progress towards broad code changes should merge to long-running branches until
  everything there is stable and deployable, at which point the long-running branch gets merged
  to `main`.
- Since short, coherent patches are easier to review, we code-review the individual PRs into
  the long-running feature branch (instead of review when merging the long-running branch to
  `main`)

## GitHub Issues & Labels

Create new Github Issues using the templates wherever possible.

## PR Review & Committing code

Multiple commits or PRs can be created for an Issue. e.g. each implementation step might get its own PR.

Code review is encouraged as a powerful tool for learning. Benefits include

- Spread knowledge of the code base throughout the team: reviewing code is a remarkably effective way to learn the codebase.
- Expose everyone to different approaches.
- Ensure code is readable (and therefore maintainable).
- Yield better software (but ultimately the responsibility
  for bug-free code is on the code author, not the reviewer).

Code review is not limited to approval/rejection of PRs. Also consider involving a collaborator
earlier in the process, before the code is finished. Ask them for a narrower reviewâ€”e.g., a
design review or to focus on a specific part of the code change.

As a reviewer:

- be kind & helpful, but do not be "nice" for the sake of avoiding conflict.
- "I find this very hard to follow" is valid feedback, even if the code's behavior is technically correct.
- Ability for code review to find defects diminishes with longer PRs: Feel free to reject any
  review that adds more than 400 lines of new code. (no upper limit on deletions!)

Merging branches and PRs to `main`:

- The branch author should be the one to merge.
- Merge PRs via 'Merge Commit' option in GitHub.
- Delete a branch when you are done with it.

# Tests

## Testing Strategy

Keep the test suite

- **complete**: every feature needs a test.
- **focused**: test behavior, not implementation.
- **stable**: tests should be deterministic and fully repeatable.
- **fast**: no sleeps, no time-based tests.

## Test Frameworks

For testing Nuxt.js and Vue, use `@nuxt/test-utils` + `@vue/test-utils` with `vitest`.
See the [Nuxt documentation on testing](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/testing).

# Coding & Documentation Style

## Prettier & ESLint for JavaScript, JSON, & SCSS

All developers are expected to use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format their JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, JSON and SCSS
code. [Configuration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) lives in [`.prettierrc`](admin_ui/.prettierrc)

> To apply Prettier autoformatting you can configure your text editor to format on save [according
> to these docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)
>
> - For VS Code, set `editor.formatOnSave` to true in your editor config.
>   or in a pre-commit hook [according to these docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html).

ESLint helps identify problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. The
[configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) lives in [`eslint.config.js`](admin_ui/eslint.config.js)

> Follow [ESLint Getting Started](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started).
> To configure ESLint in VS Code, create a `.vscode/settings.json` in the project's root and add
>
> ```
>    "eslint.nodePath": "/home/\${user}/dev/nosh-by-gosh/client/node_modules",
>    "eslint.workingDirectories": ["client"]
> ```
